1. First of all, you need to execute database.sql, it'll create new database with structure, test data and one user **
   support@check24.de** and password **123456**.
2. Edit .env file (DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_DATABASE)
3. Install dependencies - composer install
4. Enjoy the code review process =)
